# advanced-graphs
Lab work for advanced programming techniques, Software Engineering Masters, year 2


### This project uses the *jgrapht* through the *GenericGraph* class. It creates the following graph functionalities:
- shows neighbours of given vertex
- shows number of vertices in a graph
- shows number of edges in a graph
- calculates the degree of given vertex
- writes edge list to file
- calculates maximum degree of graph
- removes given edge
- removes given vertex
- creates adjacency matrix in a file
- contracts given vertex to target vertex


The results can be found in the generated txt files or in console.
