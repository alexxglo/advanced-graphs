# advanced-graphs
Lab work for advanced programming techniques, Software Engineering Masters, year 2

## LAB 1
### This project uses the *jgrapht* through the *GenericGraph* class. It creates the following graph functionalities:
- shows neighbours of given vertex
- shows number of vertices in a graph
- shows number of edges in a graph
- calculates the degree of given vertex
- writes edge list to file
- calculates maximum degree of graph
- removes given edge
- removes given vertex
- creates adjacency matrix in a file
- contracts given vertex to target vertex

## LAB 2
### Implemented 4 different classes based on the type of graph needed. All of them extend the same interface with the following graph algorithms:
- BFS
- DFS
- LexBFS
- A*
- A* all shortest paths
- Dijkstra

The results can be found in the generated txt files or in console.

The entry dataset is provided by: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/
